Machine learning and AI have become essential skills for computational materials scientists in the AI era. Here are some resources that have been particularly helpful to me:

## Machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP) related
* [MLIP Arena (not stable)](https://huggingface.co/spaces/atomind/mlip-arena)
* [MACE](https://github.com/ACEsuit/mace)
* [CHGNET](https://github.com/CederGroupHub/chgnet)
* [Flare](https://github.com/mir-group/flare)
* [MatterSim](https://github.com/microsoft/mattersim?tab=readme-ov-file)
  

## Selective Online Courses
