title: Practical Guides to First-Principle Calculations
excerpt: "As a conventional and rigourous computational materials scientist ^^"
---

These resources were invaluable to me as I developed into a 'conventional' and rigorous computational materials scientist before the AI era. However, I believe there is still essential knowledge we must acquire to remain rigorous and effective in this field.


## Books

* [**Lee**, *Computational Materials Science (An Introduction*)](https://doi.org/10.1201/9781315368429)
  * An excellent resource for beginners with a strong background in engineering and chemistry.
