title: Practical Guides to First-Principle Calculations
excerpt: "Develop the skills to become a rigorous computational materials scientist."

These resources were invaluable to me as I developed into a 'conventional' and rigorous computational materials scientist before the AI era. However, I believe there is still essential knowledge we must acquire to remain rigorous and effective in this field.
