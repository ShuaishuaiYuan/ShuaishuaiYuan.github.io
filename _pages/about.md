Hi there. My name is Shuaishuai.

Welcome to my web page!

I am currently a postdoctoral research fellow in the Physics Department at McGill University. I've been part of the McGill community since 2016, previously as a PhD student in Mining and Materials Engineering. Prior to this, I earned my master’s and bachelor’s degrees in Materials Science and Engineering from the University of Florida, USA and Jiangsu University, China, respectively. Materials science, with its highly multidisciplinary nature, acts as a bridge between the microscopic and macroscopic worlds, which has always deeply fascinated me..

My research focus on exploring electron-phonon interations in materials and devices. Electron-phonon interactions refer to the coupling between electrons (the primary charge carriers in materials) and phonons (quanta of vibrational energy in the material's lattice structure). This coupling is fundamental in dictating material's electrical conductivity, thermal properties, and optical behaviors. In semiconductor devices, for instance, electron-phonon interactions can lead to energy dissipation, affecting the performance of devices like transistors, solar cells, batteries, photoelectrochemical cells, etc. Understanding and manipulating these interactions opens up possibilities for minimizing energy losses and enhancing performance. My research employs first-principles simulations, a theoretical approach grounded in quantum mechanics. Efforts are still ongoing to enhance the efficiency of these simulations, while maintaining their accuracy and parameter-free predictive capabilities.
