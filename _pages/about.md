Hi there. My name is Shuaishuai. Welcome to my web page!

I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in the Physics Department at McGill University. I've been part of the McGill community since 2016, previously as a PhD student in Mining and Materials Engineering. I earned my master’s and bachelor’s degrees in Materials Science and Engineering from the University of Florida and Jiangsu University, respectively. 

My current research focus on exploring electron-phonon interations in materials and devices. Electron-phonon interactions refer to the coupling between electrons (the primary charge carriers in materials) and phonons (quanta of vibrational energy in the material's lattice structure). This coupling is fundamental in dictating material's electrical conductivity, thermal properties, and optical behaviors. In semiconductor devices, for instance, electron-phonon interactions can lead to energy dissipation, affecting the performance of devices like transistors, solar cells, batteries, photoelectrochemical cells, etc. Understanding and manipulating these interactions opens up possibilities for minimizing energy losses and enhancing performance. My research employs first-principles simulations, a theoretical approach grounded in quantum mechanics. Efforts are still ongoing to enhance the efficiency of these simulations, while maintaining their accuracy and parameter-free with predictive capabilities.

My fascination with materials science stems from its multidisciplinary nature, seamlessly bridging the microscopic and macroscopic worlds. There is still so much for me to discover and explore in this field.
