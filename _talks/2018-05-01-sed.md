title: "Designing energy materials from the atomic scale: the role of polarons - Shuaishuai Yuan, SEDTalks"
---

This is a talk I gave during my 2nd year PhD and it is designed for the general public.

Advanced materials are essential to delivering high-performance clean energy technologies. In many energy materials, such as Li-Air batteries, low conductivity is caused by the formation of polarons and this limits battery performance. Shuaishuaiâ€™s research explores the initial stages of polaron formation in the operation of Li-Air batteries down to the atomic scale using state-of-the-art simulation methods.  Atomic-scale engineering studies of polaron formation are a necessary step to improve the electronic or optoelectronic properties of different energy materials and their entry into the energy marketplace.
